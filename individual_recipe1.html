        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1 envelope dry active yeast</li>
            <li>2 c. lukewarm water</li>
            <li>4 1/4 c. bread flour</li>
            <li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
           <li>1/2 lb. small red-skinned potatoes</li>
            <li>2 tsp. chopped rosemary</li>
      
        </ul>
        
        <br>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: In the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast with 2 tablespoons of the water and let stand until moistened. Add the flour, 1/3 cup of olive oil, sugar, 2 teaspoons of salt, and the remaining water; mix at medium speed until a soft, supple dough forms, 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand in a draft-free spot for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 3 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. On one of the sheets, toss the potatoes with the rosemary and 1/2 cup of olive oil, and season with salt. Spread the potatoes in a single layer and bake until tender, 15 minutes. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Turn the dough out onto an oiled surface and press to deflate. Cut the dough into 12 pieces and roll into balls; transfer to the remaining 2 baking sheets and brush with the oil used to roast the potatoes. Let stand in a draft-free spot until nearly doubled in bulk, 1 hour. Fan 3 potato slices on the top of each roll and brush with more oil.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Set a sheet pan in the bottom of the oven and fill with water to create steam. Bake the focaccia rolls for 30 minutes, until golden brown; shift the pans halfway through baking. Transfer the pans to racks and let the rolls cool completely.</li>
